<h2>Kohana joins GoPHP5!</h2>
<p>The Kohana Team is proud to announce joining the <?php echo html::anchor('http://gophp5.org', 'GoPHP5 initiative') ?>.</p>
<p>The transition to PHP 5 has not been a smooth ride for many people, and early versions of PHP 5 were slow, buggy, and overall not "production ready". With PHP 5.2, these issues are almost completely gone. PHP 5.2 offers high performance, a full feature set, and a stable platform on which to build web applications.</p>
<p>Kohana's adoption of PHP 5.2 ensures a level of stability and predictability for both end-users and developers, and we expect to take full advantage of these features in the next official release of Kohana.</p>
